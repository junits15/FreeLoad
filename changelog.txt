Changelog: 

Wachusett: 
	Featureset 1:
		>10A max current
		>100W max power
		
			1.1.1.0.1 (never produced, never laid out)
			-Single switchable feedback loop system
			-high input impedance buffer amp
			
			1.1.2.1.2 (sent to production)
			Changes:
			-dual simultanious feeedback loop system
			-increased votlage measurement range with resistor divider sensing
			-dual mosfets for better dissipation
			-measurements on pin headers
			-15W sense resistor
			-4mm banana input jacks, can also suit machine screws.
			-CC mode achieved with 1V ref. derived from resistor divider.
			- +/-12V rails
			- This board was sent to ptroduction
			
			Prototype notes:
			- Issues encounered:
				- "Islands" in the ground plane causing issues, this can be temporarily fixed with jumper wires
				- resistor dividers change impedance when pot is turned, causing voltage swings that are incorrect
				- resistor dividers are simply not precise enough, Ex: Input current was limited to 8A due to .4V coming from resistor divider instead of .5.
				- Constant current mode does not work (may be caused by resistor dividers)
				- lack of 4 wire sense causes signifigant error in power calculations, power is constant but off due to voltage drop in wires.
			- Changes for next revision:
				- 4 wire sense
				- precision votlage references
				- fix ground plane
				- fix constant current
			
	Featureset 2:
		>higher input impedance
		>BNC connectors for measurement and control
		>smaller board size (reduced cost)
		>Surface mount components (reduced cost and space)
		>ADR510 precision 1V reference
		>half wave rectification
		>+/- 15V rails (increased voltage input range)
		>4 wire sense (eliminates error from voltage drop in wires)
		
			1.2.3.2.3 (sent to production)
			Changes:
			-opamps, resistors, and 633 switched to surface mount
			-power supply switched to +/- 15VDC
			-half wave AC recitification eliminates CT transformer
			-precision 1V reference added
			-BNC's added
			-input impedance upped to 100k Ohms form 60k
			-added footprints for 4xTO-220 FET's and 4xTO-247 FET's
			-board shrunk to 10cmx10cm (reduced cost to $10 + S&H from $30 + S&H)
			
		Prototype issues:
		-issues encountered
			-voltage measuremnt was wired in reverse, fixed temprarily with mod wires.
			-sense resistor is difficult to mount with a screw
			- -1.8W of error, causes load to draw 1.8W when set to 0W
			-BNC footprints are incorrect
			-input cap (C7) for clipper needs to be a short
			-switch for CC mode should be between the second feedback loop and the clipper switching to 1V reference for more precision and ease of construction
			-error in voltage measurement and power calculations because of imprecise resistor values
		
		-changes for next revision
			-high tolerance resistors
			-trimmers to remove error in power measurement 
			-re-make BNC footprints
			-remove C7 replace with short
			new switch location for CC mode
